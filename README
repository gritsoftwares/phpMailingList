================================================================================

1.) INSTALLATION
-------------------------

1.) Edit config.ini to your needs.
2.) Edit form.php, members.php and error.php to your needs.
3.) Be sure to set correct permissions for the lists-directory set in
    config.ini.
4.) Test your installation by creating a list, e.g.:

    lists/mylist/

5.) Call index.php?list=mylist to use your shiny new mailing list.

    Hint: In case you get write permission errors be sure to set the correct
          permissions for the lists-directory (and any subdirectories and
          files).

Enjoy!

2.) CONFIGURATION
--------------------------

Everything you need (or can) configure can be found in config/config.ini. You
are free to customize form.php and members.php to your needs. Make sure to leave
the core input fields "as-is".

3.) USAGE
--------------------------

phpMailingList provides the following core functionality:

1.) subscribe: Add members to a mailing list via form.php
2.) unsubscribe: Remove subscribed members from a mailing list
3.) authorize: Authorize a subscription request
4.) send message: Send messages to all members of a mailing list

In order to prevent SPAM messages a CAPTCHA field has to be filled out prior to
any of the action provided by form.php, i.e. subscribe, unsubscribe and send
messages.
